## 2024-04-25 - Prevent CSV Injection in Export Feature
**Vulnerability:** The application exports a list of usernames to a CSV file without sanitizing the data. Usernames starting with characters like `=, +, -, @` could be executed as formulas if the CSV is opened in spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets), leading to Formula Injection (CSV Injection) attacks.
**Learning:** Even internal tool data (like usernames) must be sanitized when exported to formats like CSV, as external applications parsing the data may evaluate certain characters as executable code.
**Prevention:** Always check user-controlled data before writing to a CSV. Prepend a single quote (`'`) to any string starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` to force the spreadsheet application to treat the field as plain text.

## 2026-04-26 - [Error Message Information Leakage]
**Vulnerability:** The application was exposing raw exception messages (`str(e)`) to the UI via `ToastPopup` upon export and parsing failures in `screen_export.py`, `screen_results.py`, and `screen_upload.py`.
**Learning:** This could leak sensitive system information such as directory structures and local file paths (e.g., if a `FileNotFoundError` occurs during export, the full path is shown to the user).
**Prevention:** Catch exceptions and log them using a secure backend mechanism (like `print` for a CLI or a logging framework), while displaying a generic, sanitized, user-friendly error message in the UI instead.
