## 2024-04-25 - Prevent CSV Injection in Export Feature
**Vulnerability:** The application exports a list of usernames to a CSV file without sanitizing the data. Usernames starting with characters like `=, +, -, @` could be executed as formulas if the CSV is opened in spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets), leading to Formula Injection (CSV Injection) attacks.
**Learning:** Even internal tool data (like usernames) must be sanitized when exported to formats like CSV, as external applications parsing the data may evaluate certain characters as executable code.
**Prevention:** Always check user-controlled data before writing to a CSV. Prepend a single quote (`'`) to any string starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` to force the spreadsheet application to treat the field as plain text.

## 2024-04-27 - Prevent DoS via Large Files and Long Strings in UI
**Vulnerability:** The application was vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on two fronts: memory exhaustion by parsing excessively large JSON files, and UI freezing caused by rendering artificially massive strings in CustomTkinter.
**Learning:** Desktop applications handling local, user-provided files are susceptible to DoS if they lack bounds checking. Loading a 2GB JSON file into memory, or passing a 1MB long username string to a UI widget, can easily freeze or crash the entire application thread.
**Prevention:** Always implement hard limits on input size. Check file sizes (e.g., `os.path.getsize()`) before attempting to parse them into memory. Enforce strict character limits on strings (e.g., username length) before they are passed to the UI layer.
## 2026-04-26 - [Error Message Information Leakage]
**Vulnerability:** The application was exposing raw exception messages (`str(e)`) to the UI via `ToastPopup` upon export and parsing failures in `screen_export.py`, `screen_results.py`, and `screen_upload.py`.
**Learning:** This could leak sensitive system information such as directory structures and local file paths (e.g., if a `FileNotFoundError` occurs during export, the full path is shown to the user).
**Prevention:** Catch exceptions and log them using a secure backend mechanism (like `print` for a CLI or a logging framework), while displaying a generic, sanitized, user-friendly error message in the UI instead.

## 2024-05-08 - Prevent DoS via Character Devices
**Vulnerability:** The application used `os.path.getsize()` to prevent reading overly large files. However, this returns `0` for character devices (like `/dev/zero`). Opening these bypassing the size check leads to application freezing and DoS.
**Learning:** File size checks alone are insufficient for validating user-provided file paths, especially when character devices can simulate zero-byte sizes but return infinite streams of data.
**Prevention:** Always verify that a provided file path is actually a regular file (e.g., using `os.path.isfile()`) before relying on its reported size and opening it for processing.
